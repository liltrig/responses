    <p>Type is more than letters printed onto a page. It’s a decision that requires a lot of thinking. Demographics is a key role in the decision making of type. Different typefaces provoke different emotions in people, while a font can completely change the atmosphere of the story being told.</p>

    <p>A rich man’s serif font reads a lot differently than the modern day designer’s sans. Comparing type to a golden goblet, and a clear wine glass, the picture is painted perfectly. A well decorated font is bound to draw in those who admire a more elegant glass of poison, while a bold font of plain lines and curves is a lot better to see through, and therefore more legible. This metaphor is perfect for aspiring designers, as they have to understand what a typeface says about the message being portrayed. For example: one message can display different meanings when a different typeface is used. No, I am not a philosopher.</p>

    <p>Type was always something that’s caught my eye. I always remembered reading boring texts in high school, and dreading the same, 12 point words on the pages. So boring and dreadful. Adding more exciting elements always makes a story more enjoyable. Who said that a book has to always be the same? Reactions are better enhances when the words are decorated accordingly. While this reading was also dreadful to read because of its super consistent style, there was a good message embedded within. As poetic as the words were, it was rather ironic how it explains the importance of type and the message it portrays, and yet the text was so plain. I had writer’s craft flashbacks having to read it.</p>
