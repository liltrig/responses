    <h1>The Web Designer Exposing the Humanity and Humor of the Internet</h1>

    <p>This website is aesthetically pleasing. The colours, simplicity, and symmetrical layout make it super stunning. I especially love the eyeballs everywhere. Honestly, I left the room for a minute, came back, and realized that they had literally taken over my screen. It was a nice effect, so props to them.</p>

    <p>The images are also large enough for my blind eyes to see, which is a bonus. The text also isn't so small that I need a magnifying glass to read it. I might be more blind than I thought.</p>

    <p>As a sucker for minimalism, I find this layout to be absolutely <b>beautiful.</b> There's no excessive gradients, there are minimal colours, and the flat logo is just so pleasing to look at. The scrollbar that shows the progress of how far you've gotten into the article is also a pleasant detail.</p>

    <p>If there is <i>one</i> thing that I find distracting, it's the way the header takes up like, a quarter of the screen while scrolling. Why do you do this? Why must you block my view? It reminds me of how short I am, and how it's hard to see above things. Offensive, in a way. Okay, that was just a joke, but seriously, I despise that header and how it follows me.</p>

    <div class="a">
    <p>Thatâ€™s just my opinion on this website, though.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Overall? 9/10</p>
