    <h1>The Web Designer Exposing the Humanity and Humor of the Internet</h1>

    <p>What would the world be like if everyone was <b>serious?</b> Lacking humour, everyone would be hiding behind a stoic mask, duller than rocks alongside the road. Humour is a spark of electricity that brings life to people’s eyes. Laughter fills people with fluttering feelings of joy. When people ponder about a joke; they usually link it to a verbal queue. A joke is not always just a blurb of words that evoke a chuckle from another being, a joke can be a visual masterpiece that only a few understand. A <b>joke</b> is what engages people, and pulls the right response out of them.</p>

    <p>The world of web is full of humour, as seen by professional web designer, Jon Lucas. Anyone can look at a blob of text on a web page and read it. Yet will it be enjoyable? A reasonable answer should be no. Lucas is someone who understands how humans react to visuals, and also understands how to gain a snicker from his viewers. By creating charming web pages full of puns and considerations, Lucas is able to engage the viewer and leave them with many questions. One of them being; <i>why?</i></p>

    <p>A decision is an opinion executed by following one’s standards. While it makes sense to the creator, it can be questionable to others. That’s what art is all about. A web page can also be a work of art, proven by modern designers who take the next step and turn a page full of plain text and images, and turning it into an interactive playground. Asymmetry, inconsistency, contrast and scale are game changers for a designer. Take this for consideration: a website can describe a rose. Another website can hold a photo of a rose. A better website can create the illusion of a rose using different elements such as type, shapes, and images. It takes the creative mind to take that leap and throw together the complicated pieces that solve the visual puzzle.</p>

    <p>A website is much more than just a place to read the news, connect with friends, and watch cat videos. A website is a virtual playground, but only if a designer creates one for us. Jon Lucas is  a prime example of taking that extra step, and creating something new and original to interact with. Lucas breaks the boundaries of a website and displays information in an abstract way that is engaging and puzzling to the viewer.</p>

    <div class="a">
    <p>That’s just my opinion on the importance of making an interactive website, though.</p>

        <p>Was this more of a summary or a response? I should be a philosopher.</p>
